## **Experiment 1: Implementation of OR Gate using NOR Gates**

**Description:**\
In this experiment, we will implement an OR gate using only NOR gates. The OR gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that outputs true (1) when at least one of its inputs is true (1). The NOR gate, on the other hand, is a universal gate that can be used to create any other logic gate, including the OR gate.

**Procedure:**
1. **Understanding the NOR Gate:**
   - A NOR gate is a combination of an OR gate followed by a NOT gate. It outputs true (0) only when all its inputs are false (0).
   - The truth table for a 2-input NOR gate is as follows:

   | Input A | Input B | Output (A NOR B) |
   |---------|---------|------------------|
   |    0    |    0    |         1        |
   |    0    |    1    |         0        |
   |    1    |    0    |         0        |
   |    1    |    1    |         0        |

2. **Implementing the OR Gate using NOR Gates:**
   - To implement an OR gate using NOR gates, we can use the following logic:
   - The OR gate can be expressed in terms of NOR gates as follows:
   - OR(A, B) = NOT(NOR(A, B))
   - This means that we can first use a NOR gate to get the output of NOR(A , B), and then use another NOR gate to invert that output.  

3. **Circuit Design:**
   - Connect the inputs A and B to the first NOR gate.

A Binary to BCD converter is a digital circuit that converts a binary number into its equivalent BCD representation. BCD is a form of decimal representation where each digit of a decimal number is represented by its binary equivalent.

**Procedure:**

   - The truth table for a 4-bit binary input and its corresponding BCD output is as follows:

| Binary Code |   |   |   | BCD Code |   |   |   |
|:-----------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| B₃ | B₂ | B₁ | B₀ | D₄ | D₃ | D₂ | D₁ |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

2. **Implementing the Binary to BCD Converter Circuit:**
   - The Binary to BCD converter can be implemented using a combination of logic gates to map the binary inputs to their corresponding BCD outputs.
   - The circuit design will involve creating logic expressions for each BCD output bit (D₄, D₃, D₂, D₁) which will be displayed on the BCD to seven-segment display based on the binary input bits (B₃, B₂, B₁, B₀).
